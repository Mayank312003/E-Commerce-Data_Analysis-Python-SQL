# 🛒 E-Commerce Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an E-Commerce dataset using Python and SQL (MySQL).
The project focuses on extracting actionable business insights regarding customer distribution, sales performance, and payment trends.

# 📊 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze an e-commerce database to understand market trends and customer behavior. 
It involves building an ETL pipeline to connect Python with a MySQL database, executing complex queries, and visualizing the results to support data-driven decision-making.

# 🚀 Features & Key Insights
The analysis answers critical business questions, including:
**Customer Geography:** Identification of unique customer cities and states to understand market reach.
**Sales Trends:** Quantitative analysis of order volumes, such as identifying that 45,101 orders were placed in 2017 alone.
**Product Performance:** Revenue breakdown by product category, identifying top performers like Bed Table Bath ($1.7M+) and Furniture Decoration ($1.4M+).
**Payment Analysis:** Evaluation of payment methods, revealing that nearly 100% of orders involved installment plans.
**Demographic Distribution:** Visualization of customer concentration across different states.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Database:** MySQL (Relational Database Management) 
**Programming:** Python 
**Libraries:** Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and structured analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Advanced data visualization and plotting.
mysql-connector-python: Database connectivity and ETL processing.

# 📊 Business Questions Answered
This analysis addresses the following key questions:
1. Unique cities where customers are located
2. Number of orders placed in 2017
3. Total sales per product category
4. Percentage of orders paid in installments
5. Customer distribution by state
6. Monthly order volume in 2018
7. Average number of products per order by customer city
8. Revenue contribution by product category

11. Moving average of customer order values
12. Cumulative monthly sales per year
13. Year-over-year sales growth rate
14. Customer retention rate (repeat purchase within 6 months)
15. Top 3 highest-spending customers per year

# ⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. **Database Setup:** Import the e-commerce CSV files into your MySQL environment.
2. **Configuration:** Update the connection parameters in the notebook:-
Python{
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host = "localhost",
    username = "root",
    password = "YOUR_PASSWORD",
    database = "ecommerce"
)
}
**3. Run the Analysis:** Execute the cells in E-Commerce-Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb to generate the insights and visualizations.

# 💡Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced:
1. Real-world business data analysis
2. Translating business questions into data queries
3. Identifying trends and patterns in transactional data
4. Communicating insights from data
